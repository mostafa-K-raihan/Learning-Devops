## Self Healing Mechanism

## Proxy Server

## L7 Path based routing/balancer/Header Change

## Docker Networking

docker -p 8080:80 nginx

packet comes to eth0 -> Ip Table -> L2 Bridge CIDR classless inter domain routing
2 part -> 32 bit, network and host network prefix will be same for all containers,

#ingress traffic
ip table -> go to this container with ip of network address and a port
route table

## L2 Bridge

## HOw IP Allocation works in Docker?

> ## HW CIDR
>
> DHCP how does it work?
> Network and host part?

microservice
internal & external
rq => ext => int => ext => user

> curl

> IP table vs routing table
